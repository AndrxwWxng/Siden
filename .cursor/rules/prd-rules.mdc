# Agent Team Platform: Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Agent Team is a platform that provides users with a team of AI agents that act like a real startup. Users select which roles they want (Developer, Marketing, Sales, etc.), and these agents autonomously coordinate to accomplish business goals.

## Core Value Proposition
Enable solo founders and small startups to operate like full companies by providing AI agents that function as specialized team members with distinct roles, personalities, and capabilities.

## User Personas

### Primary: Solo Founders & Early-Stage Startups
- Technical founders who need business support
- Non-technical founders who need development help
- Small teams looking to augment capabilities

### Secondary: Established Companies
- Department heads looking to augment existing teams
- CTOs evaluating AI workforce augmentation

## Key Features (MVP)

### 1. Agent Team Creation
- Users can create a new project or connect to existing one
- Select agent roles from a pre-defined list (Developer, Product Manager, Marketing)
- Each agent has a specialized personality, skillset, and access to tools

### 2. Agent Communication
- Agents communicate with each other autonomously
- Slack-like interface to view team conversations
- CEO (user) can intervene, clarify, or redirect at any time

### 3. Persistent Agent Memory
- Short-term memory for active tasks
- Long-term memory for project history and decisions
- Cross-agent memory sharing for context

### 4. Sandboxed Execution
- Isolated environments for each agent
- Security boundaries between agents
- Safe code execution for developer agents

### 5. Tool Integration (MVP)
- Google Sheets integration
- Email integration
- Basic SQL querying capabilities
- Code repository access

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to create a new project and select agent roles so I can build a virtual team.
2. As a user, I want to describe my business goal and have agents coordinate to accomplish it.
3. As a user, I want to see conversations between agents to understand their decision process.
4. As a user, I want to intervene when agents are heading in the wrong direction.
5. As a user, I want agents to maintain context across sessions.

## Success Metrics
- Project completion rate
- User intervention frequency (lower is better)
- Task completion speed
- User retention

## Out of Scope for MVP
- Custom agent creation
- Third-party agent marketplace
- Advanced integrations beyond core tools
- Full autonomous business operation

## Technical Constraints
- MVP to be built in one week
- Focus on demonstrating core value proposition
- Leverage existing APIs rather than building custom integrations
